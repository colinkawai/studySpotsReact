Study Spots

A yelp for study/work spots but with more specific ratings such as internet speed, table layout, and music. <br />
The many commits with the unoriginal commit messages is from tinkering with node and heroku connection. <br />
In short, I was not able to host it on heroku but it works locally <br />
<br />

React front end with css flexbox and to filter ratings. <br />
MongoDB atlas database to store ratings and aggregates average when client views store ratings <br />
Node.js to connect to Yelp REST API.
